npm init -y ( for initializing package.json);

npm install -D tailwindcss (Tailwind Dev dependencies);

Always remember to modify the 'Tailwind.config.js' file for your root.

Since you have to always 'watch it', run this for this particular project (the .css varies per project)
"npx tailwindcss -i styles.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch"
